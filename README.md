# cola-to-nbody
A suite of codes and pre-trained convolutional neural net models to learn the mapping between the COLA and N-Body simulations of the Universe. The model architecture can be found at https://github.com/eelregit/map2map/blob/master/map2map/models/vnet.py The model has been trained and tested using https://github.com/eelregit/map2map which is a suite of neural network emulators to transform field/map data.
